You are advised to spend 60 minutes answering the questions in this booklet. 

### Question One

(a) Write − a b +
4 2 5 in the form 5, where a and b are rational numbers.

(b) Complex numbers u *and* v are represented on the Argand diagram.

If w = u - v, then show w on the Argand diagram below.

(c) One root of the equation z3 - 3z + p = 0 is z = 2 - 3i.

If p is a real number, find the value of p and the other roots of the equation.

(d) If z w = + = +
z 1 i and 1 i, find the exact value of arg(w).

(e) If u = 6 + ki and v = 4 + ki, find k if arg(u v. ) = π4

### Question Two

(a) What is the remainder when x3 + 4x2 + 3x - 9 is divided by x + 2?

(b) If u v = = uv 2cis 2π3and 6cis π 2
, write in polar form.

(c) Find the equation whose roots are three times those of x2 + 9x - 12 = 0.

(d) If u = x + i y and au*2 +* bu + c = 0, prove that aū2 + bū + c = 0. 

(e) Describe fully the locus of the points representing z z z if 2i 2i
+
− is purely imaginary.

### Question Three

(a) Solve the equation z2 + 6z + 20 = 0.

Express the solutions in the form z a = + bi, where a and b are integers.

(b) p and q are complex numbers, where p = 3 + 4i and q = 2 - 3i.

Find pq‾, expressing your answer in the rectangular form *a + b*i.

(c) Solve the following equation for x in terms of p:
 x x - 3 = − p
(d) Find all the solutions of the equation z3 + n = 0, where n is a positive real number.

Write your solutions in polar form as expressions in terms of n.

(e) Find the values of k for which the equation 6 4 + −x x3 0 + = k has no real roots.
