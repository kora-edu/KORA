1 Simplify
(a)
x x x
(b) (x3)-2
(c)

2  Calculate the roots of the following linear equations:

(a)  3 - 2x = 4x + 1
(b)

3 Solve by factorisation:

t2 - 6t + 5 = 0 4 Solve 3w4 = 6w + 4 by using the quadratic formula.

There is no need to evaluate complicated square roots if they do not come out to simple numbers.

5  Complete the square, and hence find the roots, of the quadratic equation

$$3w^{2}-2w-2=0$$

There is no need to evaluate complicated square roots if they do not come out to simple numbers.

6  Describe the oblique asymptotes of the rational function

$$y(x)=\frac{3x^{3}+4x^{2}+14x+17}{x^{2}+4}$$

l Assignment 3 7 Show that

$$\frac{x}{4}-\frac{3}{8}-\frac{1}{4(3x+1)}$$
$$\mathbf{\Sigma}_{1,\infty}^{\infty}$$

can be expressed in the form

$$\frac{6x^{2}-7x-5}{24x+8}$$

 Sketch this rational function and state any asymptotes.

(a) logg(25)

$$\mathbf{\mu}$$

(b) log4(20)

$$(65)$$

(c) logg(65)
(d)  log(10,000)
9  Simplify to a single log term:
(a) 3 log(y) + 4 log(x)
(b)  log(x) - (log(y) + log(z)
 (c)  ln(xy) + ln(y2)
10 Solve
(a)  2ª = 1
(b) e3x-1 = 2
(c)   ve3x   =  1
(d) e2x - 4ex = —3
(e)  3 log(t) = 5
(f) log4(t3) = 2

$$\ldots,\ldots,\ldots,\ldots$$
$$(\mathrm{g})\ \ln(t-3)=1$$

11  Sketch a graph of the step function:

$$2u(t)+4u(t-1)$$

12  A ramp function is given by

$$f(t)=f$$
$$\begin{array}{l}{{3t,\;t\geq0}}\\ {{0,\;t<0}}\end{array}$$
